          <h1>A fresh take on creating websites and products people love</h1>
          <p>
            This year we came together in Berline for our first-ever HOTSAUCE
            conference. Over two days, some of the brightest minds in product,
            marketing, ecommerce, and UX joined us to connect over the future
            of digital experiences—and we had a blast.
          </p>
          <p>
            Join us next year for more visionary keynotes, peer-led
            roundtables, Hotjar masterclasses, and new connections. Be the
            first to learn about HOTSAUCE 2024 by subscribing to
            our newsletter.

        <h2>Build more empathy</h2>
        <p>HOTSAUCE isn’t just another conference. It's a chance to rethink the
          user experience after an era of disruption.
        </p>
        <p>Since 2020 the world has shifted. Accelerated trends have made
          user behavior increasingly unpredictable and we need to stay
          ahead. Across product, ecommerce, and marketing, HOTSAUCE will
          give you the tools you need to evolve with these changes.</p>
          <p>Over two days, we’ll share inspirational stories, dive deep into
            empathy, and strengthen our connection with what our users
            truly need.
